# Configuration Reference

## Configuration Cascade

Kangentic uses a three-tier config resolution:

1. **Global defaults** (`DEFAULT_CONFIG` in `src/shared/types.ts`)
2. **Global user config** (`<configDir>/config.json`)
3. **Project overrides** (`<project>/.kangentic/config.json`)

Effective config = deep-merge(global defaults, user config, project overrides).

The config directory (`<configDir>`) is platform-specific:

- **Windows:** `%APPDATA%/kangentic/`
- **macOS:** `~/Library/Application Support/kangentic/`
- **Linux:** `~/.config/kangentic/`

## Settings Panel

The panel uses a VS Code-style layout: a sidebar with tab navigation on the left and the active settings pane on the right. A search bar at the top filters settings by keyword. Search uses multi-token matching (all tokens must appear in the setting name or description). Results are grouped by tab with match count badges on the sidebar; tabs with zero matches are dimmed. Press Ctrl+F (Cmd+F on macOS) to focus the search bar, Escape to clear the filter.

- **Settings Panel** - opened via the titlebar gear icon or the gear icon on each project row in the sidebar. A project switcher dropdown in the header allows switching between projects. Sidebar tabs are grouped by category (`SETTINGS_TABS` in `settings-tabs.ts`): the `'project'` group (General, Theme, Agent, Git, Browser, Shortcuts) is per-project settings, hidden when no project is open; the `'system'` group (Board, Task, Changes, Terminal, Behavior, Hotkeys, Notifications, Dictation, Memory, MCP Server, Agent Browser, Mobile Devices, Privacy, Developer) is shared settings that apply across all projects and remain fully usable with no project open. The system group is further split into sidebar tiers (`tier` on each tab): Core (Board through Notifications, unlabeled - the default group), Advanced (Dictation through Mobile Devices), and Other (Privacy, Developer); order within each group is curated by frequency/concept rather than alphabetical, since the search bar already covers fast lookup-by-name. The Task tab holds task-presentation settings that used to live under Board (Card Density, Ticket Numbers) and Terminal (the whole Context Bar section), grouping controls that describe how an individual task presents itself rather than board layout or terminal cosmetics; Board keeps `columnWidth` and board-level Config Sync/Window settings, and Terminal keeps shell/font/cursor/colors. Terminal is global-only (shell, font, cursor style, colors): shell in particular was never reliably project-scoped at the PTY-spawn level (`SessionManager` caches a single `configuredShell` keyed to whichever project is currently focused - `src/main/pty/session-manager.ts`), so a background project's spawn/resume could silently pick up the wrong shell. See `.claude/rules/settings-tab-scope.md` for why a setting's tab must match its persistence scope. Within the project group, General saves `project.location` to the project record in the global index database via a "Change..." button that re-points the project after its folder is moved or renamed, preserving tasks and history which are keyed by project id; Theme saves `theme` to `.kangentic/config.json`; Agent, Git, and Browser also save to `.kangentic/config.json`; Shortcuts saves to the board config files (`kangentic.json` and `kangentic.local.json`). The Agent tab exposes the `project.defaultAgent` setting (the "Agent" combobox), the agent CLI used for new sessions in this project, along with `project.defaultModel` and `project.defaultEffort` (the "Model" and "Effort" comboboxes), the project-level model and reasoning-effort defaults applied when no column or task override is set. Like `project.location`, all three are stored on the project record in the global index database rather than in `AppConfig`. When the selected agent declares remote-execution support (today: OpenCode only), the Agent tab also shows an Execution mode row right below the CLI Path row, letting the project run that agent locally (the default) or attach to a server it declares support for - see [Remote Execution](#remote-execution) below; an agent without the capability shows none of these rows. The system-group tabs save to the global config. When no project is open, only the system tabs appear. Changes save immediately. New projects inherit only the seeded settings subset (`theme`, `agent.permissionMode`, `git.*`) from the most recently configured project, falling back to defaults if none exist. Project-specific data such as `browser.defaultUrl`, `importSources`, and `agent.execution` (a remote server's working directory is specific to the project it was configured for) is stored per-project and is never cloned into a new project.

### App-Only Settings

These settings appear only in App Settings and cannot be overridden per-project:

- `sidebarVisible`, `boardLayout`, `sidebar.width`
- `columnWidth`, `terminalPanelVisible`, `animationsEnabled`, `statusBarVisible`, `diffViewMode`
- `cardDensity`, `showTaskNumbers` (Task tab)
- `diffDefaultScope`, `diffIgnoreWhitespace`, `diffCollapseUnchanged`, `diffFileSort`, `diffFlatList`
- `monitor` (the Agent Monitor's own toolbar controls, not a Settings-panel entry)
- `restoreWindowPosition`
- `agent.cliPaths`, `agent.maxConcurrentSessions`, `agent.queueOverflow`, `agent.autoResumeSessionsOnRestart`
- `agent.executionServers` (per-agent remote-server url + auth; the Agent tab's Server URL / Authentication fields, shown when the selected agent declares remote-execution support)
- `agent.launchOptions` (per-agent boolean startup toggles; the Agent tab's Launch Options rows, shown when the selected agent declares launch-option capability)
- `terminal.*` (shell, font size, font family, cursor style, panel height, show preview, colors - the whole namespace is global-only)
- `autoFocusIdleSession`
- `skipBoardConfigConfirm`
- `windowLightDismiss`
- `contextBar.*` (all context bar visibility toggles; Task tab)
- `notifications.*` (all notification settings)
- `agent.idleTimeoutMinutes`
- `developer.activityDebugOverlay`, `developer.persistConsoleLogs`, `developer.recordIpcTraffic`, `developer.previewInspectionServer`, `developer.previewEvalEnabled`
- `browserAutomation.enabled`, `browserAutomation.allowInteraction`, `browserAutomation.allowNavigation`, `browserAutomation.allowEval`, `browserAutomation.restrictNavigationToLocalhost`
- `dictation.*` (all voice dictation settings)
- `memory.*` (conversation search + recall, in the Memory tab)
- `mobileBridge.*` (mobile companion app pairing/relay, in the Mobile Devices tab)
- `hotkeyOverrides`

### Per-Project Overridable Settings

These settings appear in both App Settings (as defaults) and Project Settings (as overrides):

- `theme`
- `agent.permissionMode`
- `git.worktreesEnabled`, `git.autoCleanup`, `git.defaultBaseBranch`, `git.copyFiles`, `git.initScript`, `git.linkNodeModules`, `git.prRefreshIntervalMinutes`
- `boards.autoImportIntervalMinutes`
- `browser.enabled`, `browser.defaultUrl`
- `agent.execution` (per-agent local/remote mode + server working directory; editable inline in the Agent tab for the currently-selected agent, but NOT seeded into new projects - see below)

> **Seeded vs. stored.** All settings above are stored per-project in `.kangentic/config.json` and editable in Project Settings. When a *new* project is created it is seeded with only `theme`, `agent.permissionMode`, `git.*`, and `boards.autoImportIntervalMinutes` (via `pickOverridableSubset` in `config-manager.ts`). `browser.*`, `agent.execution`, and non-setting project data such as `importSources`, are kept per-project and never cloned, so one project's dev-server URL, remote-server directory, or import sources cannot leak into another. `terminal.*` used to be seeded here too; it moved to global-only, and `loadProjectOverrides()` (`config-manager.ts`) one-time-migrates any pre-existing per-project `terminal.{shell,fontFamily,fontSize,scrollbackLines,cursorStyle,backspaceSendsCtrlH}` out of `.kangentic/config.json` (dropped, not promoted to global) the first time that project loads.

### Top-Level

| Key | Type | Default | Description |
|-----|------|---------|-------------|
| `theme` | ThemeMode | `'dark'` | UI theme. Values: `dark`, `light`, `moon`, `forest`, `ocean`, `ember`, `sand`, `mint`, `sky`, `peach` |
| `sidebarVisible` | boolean | `true` | Show/hide sidebar. Global-only. |
| `boardLayout` | `'horizontal'` \| `'vertical'` | `'horizontal'` | Board scroll direction. Global-only. |
| `cardDensity` | `'compact'` \| `'default'` \| `'comfortable'` | `'default'` | Amount of detail shown on task cards. Global-only. |
| `columnWidth` | `'narrow'` \| `'default'` \| `'wide'` | `'default'` | Width of board columns. Global-only. |
| `showTaskNumbers` | boolean | `true` | Show each task's `#N` (`display_id`) as a muted badge in the board card header. On by default; matches the number shown in the task detail header. Global-only. |
| `terminalPanelVisible` | boolean | `true` | Show the terminal panel below the board. Global-only. |
| `animationsEnabled` | boolean | `true` | Enable CSS keyframe animations (idle pulse, dialog fades, status bar pulses). Global-only. |
| `statusBarVisible` | boolean | `true` | Show the status bar at the bottom of the window. Global-only. |
| `diffViewMode` | `'split'` \| `'inline'` | `'split'` | Default layout for Git file diffs in the Changes panel (`split` = side by side, `inline` = unified). The in-diff toggle and the Changes settings tab write this same key, so the choice sticks. Global-only. |
| `diffDefaultScope` | `'working'` \| `'staged'` \| `'branch'` | `'working'` | Which changes a freshly opened Changes panel shows: `working` (uncommitted edits vs the index), `staged` (index vs HEAD), or `branch` (the whole branch vs its base). The in-panel scope control overrides it per session. Global-only. |
| `diffIgnoreWhitespace` | boolean | `false` | Hide whitespace-only changes in the diff to filter reformatting noise. The in-diff toggle and the Changes tab write this key. Global-only. |
| `diffCollapseUnchanged` | boolean | `false` | Fold away large unchanged regions so only changed hunks (with a little surrounding context) are shown. Global-only. |
| `diffFileSort` | `'name'` \| `'status'` \| `'size'` | `'name'` | How the Changes panel orders files: by name, by status (added / modified / deleted), or by size (most changes first). Global-only. |
| `diffFlatList` | boolean | `false` | Show changed files as a flat list of full paths instead of a nested directory tree. Global-only. |
| `monitor` | MonitorView | see below | Persisted Agent Monitor view. Global-only: the monitor spans every project, so a per-project override would be meaningless. Not surfaced in the Settings panel - these are the monitor's own toolbar controls, written debounced on every change so the view survives a quit or crash, not just an orderly close. |
| `monitor.layout` | `'cards'` \| `'table'` \| `'list'` | `'cards'` | How sessions are arranged. `cards` reflows 1 to 5 columns by the surface's own width (a container query, so the detached pop-out lays out by its own size rather than the main window's), stepping at 850 / 1300 / 1750 / 2200px to keep a card near a board column's width; `list` is one dense line per session. A persisted `'compact'` (the old name for `list`) is migrated on read. |
| `monitor.groupBy` | `'state'` \| `'project'` | `'project'` | Section rows by owning project or by attention bucket (Idle / Active / Paused / Recently finished). There is no "none": rows are always sectioned, and the labelled separator is what makes a card moving between sections legible rather than arbitrary. Project is the default because this view exists to span projects, so "whose agents are these" is the question a user arrives with. Attention-first ordering is a property of `state` grouping, so it applies once that is picked. An unrecognised persisted value (including the retired `'flat'`) falls back to `project`. |
| `monitor.sort` | `'longest-running'` \| `'recently-started'` | `'longest-running'` | Order WITHIN a section, shown as "Oldest" / "Newest", purely by when the session started. Ordering by attention is not offered: `state` grouping already emits its sections attention-first. Sorting by project was dropped too, since it duplicated `groupBy: 'project'`. An unrecognised persisted value (including the retired `'attention'`) falls back to `longest-running`. |
| `monitor.liveOnly` | boolean | `false` | Show only sessions with a live agent, hiding paused, queued, and recently finished ones. Reads a legacy `hideIdle` value if present. |
| `monitor.projectFilter` | string[] | `[]` | Project ids to show. Empty means every project. No toolbar control writes this: a monitor whose job is to show every agent everywhere does not need a one-project scope (that is the board), and each row names its owning project anyway. Cleared on load, so a value persisted by an older build cannot hide rows with no control able to bring them back. |
| `monitor.stateFilter` | MonitorStateBucket[] | `[]` | Attention buckets to show, as raw values: `needs-you` (shown as "Idle"), `working` ("Active"), `idle` ("Paused"), `finished` ("Recently finished"). Empty means every bucket. Like `projectFilter`, not written by any control today and cleared on load - `liveOnly` covers the case users actually asked for. |
| `monitor.textFilter` | string | `''` | Substring match across task title, project, column, agent, model, ticket number, and labels. |
| `skipDeleteConfirm` | boolean | `false` | Skip confirmation dialog on task delete. Written by the delete dialog's "don't ask again" checkbox. No longer surfaced in the Settings panel. |
| `autoFocusIdleSession` | boolean | `false` | Auto-switch to session tab when agent goes idle. Idle tabs are always highlighted regardless of this setting. |
| `windowLightDismiss` | `'off'` \| `'single'` \| `'focused'` \| `'all'` | `'focused'` | Click-outside (light-dismiss) policy for modeless task-detail windows. Clicking empty space outside a window closes it, except a control, a task card, or a running terminal, which still act on the first click. Overlays that mount outside the shell's dismiss scope (the settings panel, palettes, dialogs) never dismiss. `off` disables; `single` closes the lone window (any state) and nothing at all once a second is open; `focused` closes the focused window (any state), whether one or five are open; `all` closes every window. Closing a window does not kill its session. Global-only. |
| `hasMigratedWindowLightDismissDefault` | boolean | `false` | Internal one-shot marker. `windowLightDismiss` defaulted to `single` before the click-outside denylist landed, and because the whole config blob is persisted on every save, an upgrading install keeps that value as if it were a choice. On the first load after this key appears, a stored `single` is rewritten to `focused` once and the marker is set, so a later deliberate `single` sticks. Not persisted when the config file exists but cannot be parsed as a usable config object (invalid JSON, or valid JSON that is not an object - null, an array, a bare primitive), since the in-memory rewrite still applies for that session, so an unreadable file is not replaced with defaults on disk. Auto-set, not shown in UI. |
| `restoreWindowPosition` | boolean | `true` | Remember window size and position between launches. Global-only. |
| `hasCompletedFirstRun` | boolean | `false` | Legacy: set true on first task creation, kept for schema/fixture compatibility. No onboarding UI reads it, and it is not the walkthrough gate: creating a task is step 3 of the walkthrough, so this flips mid-flow. The walkthrough is suppressed once `onboardedProjectIds` is non-empty. Auto-set, not shown in UI. |
| `lastSeenReleaseNotesVersion` | string | `''` | The version whose release-notes modal has already been auto-shown (see [Auto-Update Behavior](deployment.md#auto-update-behavior)), so it does not reopen on every relaunch after "Later". Auto-set, not shown in UI. |
| `lastWhatsNewShownVersion` | string | `''` | The version whose post-update ["What's New" dialog](deployment.md#auto-update-behavior) has already been shown. Deliberately separate from `lastSeenReleaseNotesVersion`, which records the PENDING version when the pre-restart modal is dismissed: a user who clicks "Later" and then quits normally has the update installed by `autoInstallOnAppQuit`, and would relaunch with the new version already marked seen and the notes never read. Written when the dialog OPENS, not when it closes, so quitting with it open does not re-arm it. Seeded to the running version on a fresh install (no `config.json` existed at launch), so a first-time user is not shown notes for software they have never run. Auto-set, not shown in UI. |
| `dismissedAnnouncementIds` | string[] | `[]` | Ids of [in-app announcements](#in-app-announcements) dismissed from the banner. Pruned on write to ids still present in the active feed, so the array stays bounded with no separate cleanup. That prune is also why READ-state is not stored here: it would drain as soon as an announcement expired. Read-state lives on the [local archive](#the-local-archive) entry instead. Auto-set, not shown in UI. |
| `onboardedProjectIds` | string[] \| undefined | `undefined` | Project ids whose onboarding checklist the user has dismissed. `undefined` means the one-time upgrade backfill (on first app hydration) has not run yet; `[]` means it has run and nothing is dismissed. Global, keyed by project id like `lastActiveTaskByProject`. **Emptiness, not membership, gates the walkthrough:** the checklist auto-opens only while this list is empty, because the walkthrough teaches the app rather than a repo and must not replay on every newly added project. It becomes non-empty by three routes, all meaning "not a first run": the backfill finding an existing project, a real dismissal, or all five steps completed. A fourth, dev-only route SHRINKS it: the Developer settings tab's "Restart checklist" trigger (`resetOnboarding` in `config-store.ts`) removes one project's id, and if that was the only entry the list is empty again, re-arming the persisted install-scoped auto-open gate until the next dismissal or completion. A per-session latch still applies, so a project already auto-opened this session waits for the next launch; the trigger itself opens the checklist directly rather than relying on auto-open. That trigger is excluded from production builds. Auto-set, not shown in UI. |
| `onboardingBaseline` | Record\<string, object\> \| undefined | `undefined` | Per-project snapshot of the settings the onboarding checklist watches (`defaultAgent`, `defaultModel`, `defaultEffort`, `permissionMode`, and a `swimlaneSignature` string encoding of the board's shape), captured on first checklist open. Adding a project does not capture one by itself. While `onboardedProjectIds` is still empty, arriving at a project earns one auto-open per session, so a second project added during that first-run window does get a baseline. Once the list is non-empty the install-scoped gate is closed for good, so a project added later has no baseline until the Developer settings tab's dev-only trigger opens the checklist there, and that trigger is not reachable in a production build. Checklist steps 1 and 2 tick when live state DIFFERS from this, so opening a settings screen and closing it unchanged earns no checkmark. Both are guarded on the baseline existing, so a baseline-less project reports them un-ticked rather than complete. Keyed by project id; replaced wholesale on write (a `CONFIG_DICTIONARY_PATHS` entry). That replace semantics is what lets the same dev-only trigger DROP one project's entry so the checklist re-baselines on the next open; the first-write-wins capture never re-baselines on an ordinary reopen. Auto-set, not shown in UI. |
| `windowBounds` | object \| null | `null` | Persisted window bounds `{x, y, width, height}`. Auto-saved, not shown in UI. |
| `windowMaximized` | boolean | `false` | Whether the window was maximized at last close. Auto-saved, not shown in UI. |
| `popOutBounds` | object | `{}` | Persisted bounds + last target display id for each detached pop-out surface (usage stats, git changes, the Browser pane, the Agent Monitor), keyed by `PopOutKind` so a surface reopens on the monitor it was last placed on. Auto-saved, not shown in UI. |
| `workspaceByProject` | Record\<string, object\> | `{}` | In-app window-manager layout keyed by project ID: each entry holds the open windows (task-detail or conversation), their tiling tree, and fractional geometry. Persisted per-project (survives a project switch and an app restart), restored after sessions resolve, and anchored by taskId (task-detail) or session id (conversation) so a session respawn never orphans a window. Each entry carries a schema `version` and is clamped/validated on restore. Auto-saved, not shown in UI. |
| `commandTerminalWorkspace` | object \| null | `null` | GLOBAL layout for the Command Terminal window layer (Ctrl+Shift+P): the open command terminal window(s) and their tiling, shared across ALL projects (one blob, not keyed by project). Slot-anchored and fractional; the session stays per-project and ephemeral, so only the geometry/arrangement persists. Same schema shape as a `workspaceByProject` entry. Auto-saved, not shown in UI. |
| `monitorWorkspace` | object \| null | `null` | GLOBAL layout for the Agent Monitor's task-detail window layer: which details are open over the monitor and how they are arranged. One blob, not keyed by project, because the monitor is cross-project (windows are anchored by `projectId:taskId`). Unlike the other two layout blobs this one crosses a renderer boundary: the monitor can be hosted in the main window or in its own pop-out, each with its own window store, so this is what carries an open detail between them. Nothing stays mounted while the monitor is closed; the layout is restored on next open, skipping any task another surface has since opened. Same schema shape as a `workspaceByProject` entry. Auto-saved, not shown in UI. |
| `skipBoardConfigConfirm` | boolean | `false` | When a `kangentic.json` board change is detected (from a teammate or your own pulled-back commit), apply it immediately instead of showing the confirmation dialog. Global-only. |
| `statusBarPeriod` | UsageTimePeriod | `'live'` | Deprecated. Drove the old status-bar usage strip (removed in favor of the usage dashboard); now read once as a seed fallback for `usageStatsPeriod` and never written. Global-only. |
| `usageStatsPeriod` | UsageTimePeriod | `'live'` | Persisted time range for the usage stats dashboard. Values: `live`, `today`, `week`, `month`, `all`. One global value shared across all projects. Global-only. |
| `usageStatsScope` | `'project'` \| `'all'` | `'project'` | Persisted scope for the usage stats dashboard: the current project (`project`) or the app-wide all-projects rollup (`all`). Global-only. |
| `lastActiveTaskByProject` | Record\<string, string\> | `{}` | Per-project memory of the last user-clicked task tab in the terminal panel, keyed by project ID. Restored on project switch. Auto-saved, not shown in UI. |
| `autoNameAskedTaskIds` | string[] | `[]` | Task IDs that have already been offered an auto-rename suggestion. Persisted so a dismissed suggestion does not reappear next launch. Drained on task delete (single + bulk delete handlers in `task-crud.ts`). Auto-saved, not shown in UI. |
| `autoNameRateLimitPerHour` | number | `60` | Maximum auto-name CLI calls per rolling 60-minute window. Caps cost on burst task creation. `0` disables the limit. Enforced in the `agent:summarize` IPC handler. Global-only, not currently surfaced in the Settings panel. |
| `discoveredModelsByAgent` | Record\<string, string[]\> | `{}` | Persisted union of every model ID seen for each agent. Sources: `discoverCapabilities()` (Claude reads `~/.claude/projects/` JSONL and harvests ids from the CLI's `/model` picker via a background-warmed hidden PTY probe), live `usage.model.id` from running sessions (via `rememberDiscoveredModel` in `config-store.ts`), and override picks. Keyed by agent name. Backs the model dropdowns in the New Task / Edit dialogs and column manager so they learn new models without re-walking JSONL on each launch. Auto-saved, not shown in UI. |
| `discoveredContextWindowsByAgent` | Record\<string, Record\<string, number\>\> | `{}` | Empirically-observed context-window size (tokens) per model, learned from a live session's `status.json` (`context_window.context_window_size`, via `rememberModelContextWindow` in `config-store.ts`). Keyed by agent name, then by BASE model id (the `[1m]`/dated suffix stripped). The window is not derivable from a model id alone (a plain `claude-opus-4-8` runs 1M on a 1M-entitled account, 200K elsewhere), so it is discovered from telemetry rather than hardcoded. Backs the context-size badge (`1M` / `200K`) on the model dropdowns, which appears only for a model whose window has actually been observed. Last-observation-wins. Auto-saved, not shown in UI. |
| `hotkeyOverrides` | Record\<string, string\> | `{}` | User hotkey overrides: keybinding action id (e.g. `commandBar.toggle`) to a canonical combo string. A combo is either a keyboard chord (e.g. `Mod+Shift+K`, where `Mod` is Cmd on macOS and Ctrl elsewhere) or a mouse button (`Mouse:Middle`, `Mouse:Back`, `Mouse:Forward`), so any action can be rebound to either input. Absent keys use the registry default in `src/shared/keybindings.ts`. Edited in the Hotkeys settings tab; replaced wholesale on save (a `CONFIG_DICTIONARY_PATHS` entry) so a reset deletes the key. Global-only. |

### terminal.*

| Key | Type | Default | Description |
|-----|------|---------|-------------|
| `terminal.shell` | string \| null | `null` | Shell executable path. `null` = auto-detect. Global-only: `SessionManager` caches a single configured shell keyed to whichever project is currently focused, so per-project scoping was never reliable at the PTY-spawn level. |
| `terminal.fontFamily` | string | `'Menlo, Consolas, "Courier New", monospace'` | Terminal font family. Global-only. |
| `terminal.fontSize` | number | `14` | Terminal font size (px). Global-only. |
| `terminal.showPreview` | boolean | `false` | Show terminal preview in task cards. Global-only. |
| `terminal.panelHeight` | number | `250` | Bottom panel height (px). Global-only. |
| `terminal.panelCollapsed` | boolean | `false` | Whether the bottom terminal panel is collapsed. Global-only. |
| `terminal.cursorStyle` | `'block'` \| `'underline'` \| `'bar'` | `'block'` | Terminal cursor appearance. Global-only. |
| `terminal.backspaceSendsCtrlH` | boolean | `false` | When enabled, plain Backspace sends Ctrl+H (`0x08`) instead of xterm's default Delete (`0x7f`), so Claude Code's TUI deletes the previous word instead of one character (Claude reads `0x08` as a modified backspace regardless of platform; `0x08` is the byte native Windows conhost happens to send for plain Backspace, but the behavior is not Windows-specific). Settings panel label: "Word delete on Backspace". Opt-in (off by default on all platforms) so existing users are never surprised by a Backspace behavior change; Ctrl+W, Alt+Backspace, and Ctrl+Backspace already word-delete regardless of this setting. Global-only. |
| `terminal.colors` | `TerminalColorOverrides` | `{}` | Custom terminal background, foreground, and cursor color, edited via color swatches in the Terminal settings tab's Colors section. Any slot left unset falls back to the built-in default: background `#0c0c0c`, foreground/cursor `#e4e4e7`. The 16-color ANSI palette (based on Windows Terminal's "Campbell" scheme) is a fixed built-in scheme, not exposed for per-color editing. `cursorAccent` always tracks the resolved background (for cursor legibility) and `selectionBackground` is a fixed app accent; neither is user-customizable. A dictionary-style field (`CONFIG_DICTIONARY_PATHS`): saved wholesale so resetting a slot actually deletes it. Global-only. |

### agent.*

| Key | Type | Default | Description |
|-----|------|---------|-------------|
| `agent.permissionMode` | PermissionMode | `'acceptEdits'` | Default permission mode for spawned agents |
| `agent.cliPaths` | Record\<string, string \| null\> | `{}` | Per-agent CLI path overrides keyed by agent name. Empty = auto-detect all. Global-only. |
| `agent.maxConcurrentSessions` | number | `8` | Max concurrent PTY sessions. Global-only. |
| `agent.queueOverflow` | `'queue'` \| `'reject'` | `'queue'` | What to do when max sessions reached. Global-only. |
| `agent.idleTimeoutMinutes` | number | `0` | Auto-suspend sessions after this many minutes idle. 0 = disabled. Global-only. |
| `agent.autoResumeSessionsOnRestart` | boolean | `true` | When true, agent sessions that were running at last close auto-resume when Kangentic restarts. When false, sessions stay paused and require a manual Resume click on each task. Turn off if auto-resuming many agents at once overwhelms your machine. Global-only. |
| `agent.executionServers` | Record\<string, AgentExecutionServer\> | `{}` | Global, agent-keyed remote-server identity: `{ url, auth }`. `auth` is `{kind:'none'}`, `{kind:'basic', username, password}`, or `{kind:'bearerEnv', envVarName}`. Machine-scoped like `agent.cliPaths` - names a server, not a project. Global-only. |
| `agent.execution` | Record\<string, AgentProjectExecution\> | `{}` | Per-project, agent-keyed: `{ mode: 'local' \| 'remote', workingDirectory }`. An absent entry means local. `workingDirectory` is a path ON THE SERVER for this project's tasks. See [Remote Execution](#remote-execution). |
| `agent.launchOptions` | Record\<string, Record\<string, boolean\>\> | `{}` | Global, agent-keyed boolean startup toggles: agent name -> option id -> enabled. An absent entry falls back to the adapter's declared default. Machine-scoped like `agent.cliPaths`. Global-only. Today only Codex declares one option, `disableApps` (launches with `--disable apps` to skip the optional cloud ChatGPT Apps MCP connector, which can hang startup at "Booting MCP server: codex_apps"). |

PermissionMode values:

- `default` -- uses `--settings` (project-settings behavior)
- `plan` -- `--permission-mode plan` (read-only tools auto-approved)
- `acceptEdits` -- `--permission-mode acceptEdits` (edits auto-approved)
- `dontAsk` -- `--permission-mode dontAsk` (all tools auto-approved except dangerous ones)
- `auto` -- `--permission-mode auto` (classifier-based auto-approval)
- `bypassPermissions` -- `--dangerously-skip-permissions` (no prompts at all)

All six modes are available in both the global App Settings "Permissions" dropdown and the per-column Edit Column dialog. The dropdown shows only the modes supported by the active agent (e.g., Cursor CLI only exposes Interactive and Non-Interactive; Oz CLI exposes Plan, Default, and Auto via Warp agent profiles).

### Remote Execution

An agent adapter can declare `remoteExecution` on `AgentAdapter` (`src/main/agent/agent-adapter.ts`) to support attaching to a server the user runs, instead of always spawning a local process. Today only OpenCode declares it (`opencode attach <url> --dir <serverPath>`). The fields live inline in the Agent settings tab, right after the CLI Path row, and render only when the currently-selected agent declares the capability (`AgentExecutionFields` in `src/renderer/components/settings/tabs/agent-execution-fields.tsx`) - an agent without it (everyone else) shows none of these rows, since the Agent tab only ever displays the one currently-selected agent.

The configuration splits along a scope seam:

- **`agent.executionServers[name]`** (global) is the server's identity - URL and auth. It is machine-scoped, like `agent.cliPaths`: the same server is available to every project on this machine.
- **`agent.execution[name]`** (per-project) is this project's use of that server - `local` or `remote`, and if remote, the working directory ON THE SERVER for this project's tasks. It is intentionally excluded from new-project seeding (see the seeding note above) - a remote server's directory is specific to the project it was configured for.

At spawn time, `resolveExecutionTarget()` (`src/main/agent/shared/execution-target.ts`) combines both into a single `ResolvedExecutionTarget` and threads it through `CommandOptions.executionTarget`, populated at both spawn chokepoints (`transition-engine.ts`, `session-startup/prepare-spawn.ts`) per `spawn-entry-point-parity.md`. It throws (rather than silently spawning locally) if a project's mode is `remote` but no server URL is configured.

An adapter may also set `AgentRemoteExecutionInfo.remoteModeCaveat` - a short string shown under the remote fields (e.g. which Kangentic features, like MCP or the activity plugin, are unavailable in remote mode for that agent). The renderer only ever renders whatever string the adapter provides; it never branches on agent name to decide the copy, per `agent-adapters-boundary.md`.

When a project's mode for an agent is `remote`:

- `ensureTaskWorktree` (`src/main/ipc/helpers/task-git.ts`) skips creating a local git worktree - the task's `worktree_path` stays `null`, and the configured server-side directory travels separately via `executionTarget`, never through `cwd`.
- For OpenCode specifically: the local `probeAuth()` (reads `~/.local/share/opencode/auth.json`) is bypassed in favor of a `GET /global/health` reachability probe (`remoteExecution.probeServer`, surfaced to the renderer's "Test connection" button via the `agent:probeExecutionServer` IPC channel); the transcript is read over HTTP (`GET /session/:id/message`) instead of the local SQLite database; the activity plugin is not installed (the server's filesystem is not local); and the Kangentic MCP server is not wired in. This is not a reachability problem `mcpServer.callbackHost` can fix: `opencode attach <url>` is a stateless HTTP client to a server that was started, and had its config fixed, independently and earlier - its CLI surface has no config-push flags, so env vars Kangentic sets on the spawned attach process are never read by the already-running server, whether that server is local or genuinely remote. See [MCP Server > Network Access](mcp-server.md) for the full reasoning and the (non-durable, since port/token rotate on restart) manual workaround. PTY-silence activity detection and PTY-output session-ID capture both continue to work unchanged, since `opencode attach` still runs a real TUI over the local PTY.

### git.*

| Key | Type | Default | Description |
|-----|------|---------|-------------|
| `git.worktreesEnabled` | boolean | `true` | Enable git worktrees for task isolation |
| `git.autoCleanup` | boolean | `true` | Delete branches when worktrees are removed |
| `git.defaultBaseBranch` | string | `'main'` | Default base branch for worktrees |
| `git.copyFiles` | string[] | `[]` | Files to copy from repo root into worktrees |
| `git.initScript` | string \| null | `null` | Shell script run in each new worktree after creation (and after `node_modules` linking). Runs via the platform shell (cmd.exe on Windows, sh on POSIX). A non-zero exit, timeout (10 min cap), or cancellation fails worktree creation. |
| `git.linkNodeModules` | boolean | `true` | Symlink the root `node_modules` into each worktree so agents skip a fresh install. Disable to let `git.initScript` install dependencies inside the worktree instead. |
| `git.prRefreshIntervalMinutes` | number \| null | `5` | Minutes between background PR sweeps while the project is open. Each sweep refreshes linked PRs' state and discovers/links a PR for an unlinked task with a live worktree. `null` = off (the on-open sweep still runs) |

### Shortcuts

Shortcuts are custom command buttons displayed in the task detail dialog header and kebab menu. They are configured in the Shortcuts settings tab (not stored in `AppConfig`). Shortcut definitions are saved in the board config files:

- **Team shortcuts** in `kangentic.json` (committed, shared)
- **Personal shortcuts** in `kangentic.local.json` (gitignored, local-only)

Each shortcut has a label, Lucide icon name, shell command, and display location (header, menu, or both).

Template variables available in shortcut commands (defined in `src/shared/template-vars.ts`):

| Variable | Value |
|----------|-------|
| `{{cwd}}` | Working directory (worktree path or project path) |
| `{{branchName}}` | Git branch name |
| `{{taskTitle}}` | Task title (shell-sanitized to prevent injection) |
| `{{projectPath}}` | Project root directory path |

IPC channels for shortcuts are in the Board Config group: `boardConfig:getShortcuts`, `boardConfig:setShortcuts`, `boardConfig:shortcutsChanged`.

### Board Profiles

A **Board Profile** is a named alternate set of per-column strategy settings (agent, model, effort,
permission mode, auto-command, auto-command mode, auto-spawn, handoff context, session target,
session spawn strategy, plan-exit target). A task selects one and rides its ladder as it moves - so one task can run Planning
in Opus xhigh and Merge in Sonnet high while another runs the same board more cheaply. Column
*identity* (which columns exist, their name, order, role, color, icon) is singular across profiles;
only strategy is profile-scoped.

Profiles are authored in the Board Manager (Edit Columns) and stored under a `profiles` key in
`kangentic.json`. Unlike shortcuts they are **team-only** - never `kangentic.local.json` - because
`tasks.profile_id` is resolved on every machine that opens the board, so a personal-only profile
would leave teammates with tasks pointing at an id they cannot resolve. Boards with no profiles omit
the key entirely.

```json
"profiles": [
  {
    "id": "6f3d9c21-...",
    "name": "Heavy",
    "columns": {
      "<swimlane-uuid>": { "modelOverride": "opus", "effortOverride": "xhigh" },
      "<swimlane-uuid>": { "modelOverride": null }
    }
  }
]
```

Entries are keyed by **swimlane uuid** (a rename must not detach in-flight tasks) and are **sparse**,
with three distinct states per setting:

| Form | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| key omitted | Inherit the column's own setting |
| key set to `null` | Clear to the agent default, overriding the column's own pin |
| key set to a value | Use that value in this column |

That third state is why the resolver (`src/main/transition-engine/column-strategy.ts`) branches on
key *presence* and never `??`: under `??`, "run the agent default here even though the column pins
one" is indistinguishable from "inherit", and a profile could only ever add pins, never remove them.

A task's assignment lives in the per-project database (`tasks.profile_id`), not in config: the
profile *definition* is team-shared, the *assignment* is per-task local runtime state. A task
pointing at a profile a teammate deleted degrades to the columns' own settings and logs once. The
same is true of `tasks.run_mode`, which records which of the dialog's two branches the task is on
(see [Database > tasks table](database.md#tasks-table)).

Profiles are mutually exclusive with the task's Advanced agent/model/effort/permission pins and with
`run_mode: 'agent_override'`, enforced at write time in `TaskRepository`.

IPC channels are in the Board Config group: `boardConfig:getBoardProfiles`,
`boardConfig:setBoardProfiles`, `boardConfig:boardProfilesChanged`. Agents can read and edit
profiles (including across projects) via the `kangentic_*_board_profile` MCP tools - see
[MCP Server > Board Profiles](mcp-server.md#board-profiles).

### mcpServer.*

| Key | Type | Default | Description |
|-----|------|---------|-------------|
| `mcpServer.enabled` | boolean | `true` | Allow agents to create and query tasks via MCP tools. When disabled, no kangentic MCP server is injected into sessions. See [MCP Server](mcp-server.md). |
| `mcpServer.bindAddress` | string | `'127.0.0.1'` | Interface the in-process MCP HTTP server listens on. Not exposed in Settings UI - edit `config.json` directly. Widening past loopback exposes the server to other machines; read once at startup. Use a wildcard (`0.0.0.0`), which binds loopback too - binding one specific non-loopback interface leaves loopback unbound and breaks every local agent. See [MCP Server > Network Access](mcp-server.md). |
| `mcpServer.callbackHost` | string \| undefined | unset | Not exposed in Settings UI - edit `config.json` directly. Allowlisted alongside `bindAddress` for DNS-rebinding-protection so a real external request is not rejected. Does not auto-wire a remote OpenCode session (see [MCP Server > Network Access](mcp-server.md)). |

### notifications.*

| Key | Type | Default | Description |
|-----|------|---------|-------------|
| `notifications.desktop.onAgentIdle` | boolean | `true` | Desktop notification when agent goes idle on non-visible project |
| `notifications.desktop.onAgentCrash` | boolean | `true` | Desktop notification when session exits with error |
| `notifications.desktop.onPlanComplete` | boolean | `true` | Desktop notification when plan completes and task auto-moves |
| `notifications.desktop.onSpawnStalled` | boolean | `true` | Desktop notification when a task spawn stays in a preparing phase (worktree/git queue) past the stall threshold (~8s) |
| `notifications.toasts.onAgentIdle` | boolean | `true` | In-app toast when agent goes idle |
| `notifications.toasts.onAgentCrash` | boolean | `true` | In-app toast when a session exits (error or clean); the `notifications.desktop.onAgentCrash` row fires on error exits only |
| `notifications.toasts.onPlanComplete` | boolean | `true` | In-app toast when plan completes |
| `notifications.toasts.onSpawnStalled` | boolean | `true` | In-app toast (with a Cancel action) when a task spawn stalls past the threshold while preparing |
| `notifications.toasts.durationSeconds` | number | `4` | Toast auto-dismiss time in seconds (1-30) |
| `notifications.toasts.maxCount` | number | `5` | Maximum simultaneous visible toasts (1-10) |
| `notifications.cooldownSeconds` | number | `10` | Minimum wait between repeat desktop notifications per session |

### contextBar.*

| Key | Type | Default | Description |
|-----|------|---------|-------------|
| `contextBar.showShell` | boolean | `true` | Show the shell name (e.g., pwsh, bash) in the context bar |
| `contextBar.showVersion` | boolean | `true` | Show the agent CLI version |
| `contextBar.showElapsed` | boolean | `true` | Show the ticking wall-clock elapsed time since the session started |
| `contextBar.showCost` | boolean | `true` | Show the cumulative session cost in dollars |
| `contextBar.showToolCalls` | boolean | `true` | Show the live cumulative tool-call count (click for the per-tool breakdown) |
| `contextBar.showAgentActive` | boolean | `false` | Show the agent active time reported by the CLI |
| `contextBar.showTokens` | boolean | `true` | Show token usage (input + output) |
| `contextBar.showContextFraction` | boolean | `true` | Show the context window usage percentage |
| `contextBar.showProgressBar` | boolean | `true` | Show the context window progress bar |
| `contextBar.showRateLimits` | boolean | `true` | Show adapter-reported plan-usage quota bars. Each window is self-described by the agent adapter (e.g. Claude reports a 5-hour session and 7-day weekly window). Hidden for adapters that do not report rate limits. |

The model and effort pills are intentionally NOT toggleable. They double as in-place picker triggers (clicking them opens a popover that lets the user switch models/effort without restarting the session), so a "hide" toggle would silently disable that feature. They render whenever a session reports a model.

All context bar settings are global-only and cannot be overridden per-project.

### backlog.*

| Key | Type | Default | Description |
|-----|------|---------|-------------|
| `backlog.priorities` | Array<{ label: string; color: string }> | See below | Priority levels for backlog items. Default: None (#6b7280), Low (#3b82f6), Medium (#eab308), High (#f97316), Urgent (#ef4444). |
| `backlog.labelColors` | Record<string, string> | `{}` | Mapping of label names to hex colors for backlog item labels. Empty by default; colors are assigned as labels are created. |

### boards.*

| Key | Type | Default | Description |
|-----|------|---------|-------------|
| `boards.autoImportIntervalMinutes` | number \| null | `null` | Minutes between background auto-import sweeps that pull new issues from the project's saved import sources (`importSources`) into the backlog. `null` = off (opt-in): no timer and no on-open sweep. Project-overridable; edited in the General tab. |

### sidebar.*

| Key | Type | Default | Description |
|-----|------|---------|-------------|
| `sidebar.width` | number | `400` | Sidebar width (px). Global-only. |

### browser.*

| Key | Type | Default | Description |
|-----|------|---------|-------------|
| `browser.enabled` | boolean | `true` | Show the Browser pill in task detail headers, and let agents open the pane (`kangentic_browser_open_pane` refuses with `browser-pane-disabled` when off). Disable for security-sensitive projects that should not embed external sites. Per-project overridable (stored per-project; not seeded into new projects). |
| `browser.defaultUrl` | string \| undefined | `undefined` | Project default URL when a task has no per-task URL override. Auto-saved when the user first navigates the Browser pane. Per-project overridable (stored per-project; not seeded into new projects). |

**Action (not a config key):** the Browser tab also exposes a destructive **Clear Browser Data** button (registry id `browser.clearStorage`) that wipes cookies, localStorage, IndexedDB, service workers, and HTTP/auth caches across the per-worktree embedded browser partitions (`persist:kngbrowser-<hash(worktreePath)>`) plus the legacy shared jar (`persist:kangentic-browser`). Saved URLs are kept. Backed by the `browser:clearStorage` IPC channel; not persisted in `AppConfig`.

### browserAutomation.*

Global-only policy (no per-project override) for whether and how an agent may drive the embedded Browser pane via the `kangentic_browser_*` MCP tools. Distinct from `browser.*` (the per-project pane settings); lives below the settings separator in its own **Agent Browser** tab and is read live on each tool call.

| Key | Type | Default | Description |
|-----|------|---------|-------------|
| `browserAutomation.enabled` | boolean | `true` | Master switch. When false the entire `kangentic_browser_*` family returns an actionable disabled error. |
| `browserAutomation.allowInteraction` | boolean | `true` | Allow click / type / keypress / drag. When false the agent is observe-only (screenshots and DOM reads still work). |
| `browserAutomation.allowNavigation` | boolean | `true` | Allow navigating the pane to other URLs. When false the agent is confined to the loaded page. |
| `browserAutomation.allowEval` | boolean | `false` | Allow `kangentic_browser_eval` (arbitrary JavaScript in the loaded page's origin). Off by default - the one unbounded primitive. |
| `browserAutomation.restrictNavigationToLocalhost` | boolean | `false` | Only allow navigation to localhost / private hosts, never public sites. Off by default (any http(s) URL allowed). |

### Dictation

Free, fully-local push-to-talk voice-to-text into whatever the user is focused in: hold a key
(default a mouse side button), speak, watch a live transcript stream into the target, and on release
the finalized text is inserted (and optionally submitted). The TARGET is resolved by precedence, and
a focused text field outranks every terminal tier - any input, textarea, or rich-text host anywhere
in the app, plus fields inside an embedded browser's guest page; a terminal is the fallback, not the
rule. A password field REFUSES outright rather than falling through to a terminal, and says so on the
chip. Because the default binding is a mouse button that also means "back", press DURATION separates
the two: a hold dictates, and a tap under `NAVIGATION_TAP_MS` instead navigates an active Browser
pane's history. See `docs/embedded-browser.md` decisions 21 and 24 for the target rules in full.
Global-only (App Settings only; no per-project override).
Engines run on-device via `sherpa-onnx-node`; a Cloud refinement option routes only the final clip to
an OpenAI-compatible endpoint. The first six keys below are settings-panel rows; the rest are
config-only (driven by the Mode preset + Live/Refinement model dropdowns).

| Key | Type | Default | Description |
|-----|------|---------|-------------|
| `dictation.enabled` | boolean | `false` | Master on/off. Enables push-to-talk. (Transcription section row.) |
| `dictation.language` | string (BCP-47) | `'en'` | Spoken language. The Live/Refinement model dropdowns narrow to models that support it; non-English uses the multilingual Whisper builds. (Transcription section row.) |
| `dictation.punctuation` | boolean | `true` | Add punctuation + capitalization to the committed text. (Transcription section row.) |
| `dictation.autoSubmit` | boolean | `true` | Press Enter automatically after inserting, or leave the text in the target for review. How that happens depends on the target: a terminal goes through the paste engine's settle -> Enter -> evidence path, a text field gets a plain Enter dispatched on it. It is REFUSED in two cases regardless of this setting - a field inside a `<form>` holding more than one text field (so dictating a title into New Task cannot create the task with the rest empty), and any field inside a guest page (fill only, since Enter there commits a form we do not control). The chip shows the resolved decision, so its hint never promises a send that will not happen. (Input section row.) |
| `dictation.releaseBufferMs` | number | `250` | Keep capturing this many ms after release so the last word is not clipped; snaps to 50ms steps (0-500); 0 = off. (Input section row.) |
| `dictation.remote` | DictationRemoteEndpoint \| undefined | `undefined` | OpenAI-compatible `/v1/audio/transcriptions` endpoint (`url`, `apiKey`, `model`) used when the Refinement model is set to Cloud. (Cloud backend section row.) |
| `dictation.engineMode` | DictationEngineMode | `'auto'` | Engine selection (`'auto'` tiers by hardware; `'remote'` = cloud final). Config-only; set by the Refinement dropdown's Cloud option. |
| `dictation.modelId` | string \| null | `null` | The FINAL (accurate) model id, `null` = the tier default (Parakeet), `'none'` = no post-processing pass. Config-only (Refinement dropdown). |
| `dictation.liveModelId` | string \| null | `undefined` | The LIVE (preview) model id: absent = the streaming Zipformer, an offline id = chunked live, `'none'` = no live preview. Config-only (Live dropdown). |
| `dictation.mode` | `'fast'`/`'balanced'`/`'accurate'`/`'custom'` | `undefined` | Quality preset. A preset sets AND locks the Live + Refinement models; `'custom'` unlocks them. UI-only; the engine reads the resolved model ids. |
| `dictation.experience` | `'popup'`/`'docked'`/`'live'` | `'popup'` | Live UI surface. Ships as `'live'` (the transcript types straight into the resolved target, terminal or text field, each revision replacing the last in place). Config-only. |

### Hotkeys

Lists every keyboard hotkey grouped by area (General, Task Detail, Git Changes, Windows, Browser, Terminal, Developer) and lets the user rebind the configurable ones. Global-only (per-machine). Each row's capture widget records the next key chord or a mouse button press (middle or side buttons, so an action can be bound to either input; Escape cancels) and probes whether that combo is already claimed by the OS or another app (via the `keybindings:probeGlobal` IPC channel), warning if so. Two actions resolving to the same combo in overlapping scopes are flagged as a conflict. Reset-to-default is available per row and for all at once. Terminal clipboard combos (Copy, Paste) and Escape are shown read-only. The registry of every hotkey + default combo lives in `src/shared/keybindings.ts`; handlers read their effective combo through the `useKeybinding` hook. Overrides persist to the `hotkeyOverrides` key (see the Top-Level table above). The **Git Changes** group adds four cross-file diff-navigation hotkeys for the Changes panel, scoped to the task dialog and gated on the focused window: `changes.nextChange` (Alt+Down, also F7) and `changes.prevChange` (Alt+Up, also Shift+F7) step through hunks and roll over into the adjacent file at the boundaries, while `changes.nextFile` (Alt+Shift+Down) and `changes.prevFile` (Alt+Shift+Up) jump whole files. The **General** group also carries the description editor's three fixed formatting keys, shown read-only for the same reason the terminal clipboard combos are: `description.bold` (Mod+B), `description.italic` (Mod+I), and `description.link` (Mod+K) wrap the selection in markdown, and are handled inside the editor's own keydown handler rather than through `useKeybinding`. Their sibling `description.pastePlain` (Mod+Shift+V) is `hidden` and so does not appear at all. Because `detectConflicts` resolves rebindable actions only, a later rebind landing on one of these four combos is not flagged as a conflict; the listing is the warning.

### Memory

The Memory tab hosts conversation search + recall - a local index over agent conversation transcripts powering the Quick Find "Conversations" group (for you) and the `kangentic_search` MCP tool (for agents). It sits next to Dictation (both are on-device, keyless, model-backed AI features). Global-only (per-machine). Keyword search is on by default; the semantic layer is opt-in.

| Key | Type | Default | Description |
|-----|------|---------|-------------|
| `memory.indexingEnabled` | boolean | `true` | Index agent conversation transcripts locally for search and recall. Off: no indexing runs, no conversation hits appear in Quick Find or `kangentic_search`, and the embed worker never starts. All local and keyless. |
| `memory.semanticEnabled` | boolean | `false` | Enable the semantic (embedding) layer on top of lexical search. Turning it on triggers a one-time local model download (the selected `memory.embeddingModel`) and background embedding of the index. Runs in an Electron utilityProcess (transformers.js on onnxruntime-node; execution provider set by `memory.acceleration`); vector search via the sqlite-vec extension. Lexical FTS5 search works regardless; when the model or extension is unavailable, Smart search transparently falls back to lexical. |
| `memory.embeddingModel` | string | `'bge-base'` | Which local embedding model powers semantic search, chosen by quality in the Memory tab's "Search quality" dropdown. Options (see `src/shared/embedding-models.ts`), all from the bge-*-en-v1.5 family: `bge-small` (Balanced, 384d, ~34 MB), `bge-base` (Accurate, 768d, ~110 MB), `bge-large` (Best accuracy, 1024d, ~337 MB). All ONNX/q8, keyless, offline, CLS-pooled with the same retrieval query prefix - only size/dimensions/accuracy scale between tiers. The dropdown shows the quality word; the concrete model name + size + download state show in the status card below it. Switching re-embeds the index in the background; a dimension change (e.g. to `bge-large`) recreates the vector table. |
| `memory.acceleration` | `'auto' \| 'gpu' \| 'cpu'` | `'auto'` | Which hardware the embedding model runs on, set in the Memory tab's "Hardware acceleration" dropdown. `auto` (default) and `gpu` prefer a GPU execution provider (DirectML on Windows, WebGPU elsewhere) and fall back to CPU if it fails to initialize; `cpu` forces the universal path. Offloading to an idle GPU keeps the CPU free for the agents when many run at once. The active backend ("DirectML (GPU)", "CPU", ...) is shown in the status card. All local and keyless. |

Relevance filtering is automatic, with no user-facing threshold. These
sentence-embedding models are anisotropic: unrelated text does not score ~0, it
scores near a high, model-specific cosine baseline (bge sit around 0.6), so a raw
cosine threshold is neither portable across models nor legible to a user. Each
model instead declares an empirical `noiseFloor`, and the search filter rescales
raw cosine against it into a model-independent relevance (`(cos - floor) / (1 -
floor)`); a single internal cutoff then drops off-topic and gibberish hits on
every model while keeping genuine matches. Only the semantic layer is filtered;
lexical (keyword) hits always appear. Applied wherever semantic search runs:
Quick Find and `kangentic_search`.

Search mode is not a stored preference: the Quick Find palette auto-selects it
from `memory.semanticEnabled` (Smart/hybrid when on, keyword when off), so there
is no per-search toggle. The Memory tab also offers a "Rebuild index" action that
purges and re-runs the backfill sweep for the current project (recovery from a
stale or corrupt index).

### Mobile Bridge

The Mobile Devices tab hosts the desktop half of the mobile companion app's pairing/transport link (`src/main/mobile-bridge/`, see [Mobile Bridge](mobile-bridge.md)). Global-only (per-machine) - the identity, roster, and relay connection represent this desktop installation, not any one project.

| Key | Type | Default | Description |
|-----|------|---------|-------------|
| `mobileBridge.enabled` | boolean | `false` | Master switch. When `false`, no relay connection is held and pairing is unavailable. The relay Select, its URL field, and Test connection carry a real `disabled`; the pairing controls are instead made inert by their section wrapper's `pointer-events-none`. Each of the tab's two sections ends in a documentation link (**How the relay works**, **How to install and pair**) rendered OUTSIDE that gating, since someone still deciding whether to enable the bridge is exactly the person who has not enabled it. |
| `mobileBridge.relayMode` | `'hosted' \| 'local' \| 'custom'` | `'hosted'` | `'hosted'` always dials the Kangentic-hosted relay (`wss://relay.kangentic.com`), in every build. `'local'` is a dev-only mode: the Select only offers it in a dev build, and `resolveRelayMode()` itself gates the mode on `__KANGENTIC_DEV__` - a dev build dials `ws://127.0.0.1:8080` (`src/shared/relay.ts`'s `LOCAL_DEV_RELAY_URL`), while a production build reports and dials `'hosted'` even if a persisted `relayMode: 'local'` reaches it (e.g. carried over from a dev build's config in the same shared configDir). Both `resolveRelayUrl()` and the settings Select read `resolveRelayMode()`, so the mode shown and the URL dialed cannot disagree. `'custom'` dials `relayUrl` instead, for self-hosters. |
| `mobileBridge.relayUrl` | string | `''` | The self-hosted relay to dial. Only consulted when `relayMode === 'custom'`; resolve the actual dial address through `resolveRelayUrl()` rather than reading this key directly - it normalizes the value and falls back to the hosted relay if this is empty or fails validation, so it never resolves to `''`. |

**Tab layout:** below the master switch the tab is two peer sections, **Relay** (where this desktop connects) and **Mobile** (which phones may use it). Each is a gated control area followed by an ungated documentation link. `Relay` is a section heading only, never also a row label inside itself. The Mobile section is named for the device rather than the ceremony: "Pairing" over a `Pair a device` button and a `Paired Devices` list stacked three "pair"s deep.

**Actions (not config keys):** the tab also exposes three settings-registry entries that are UI surfaces, not `AppConfig` keys. **Pair a Device** (registry id `mobileBridge.pairing`) starts the QR pairing ceremony described in [Mobile Bridge](mobile-bridge.md#pairing-ceremony), and **Paired Devices** (registry id `mobileBridge.devices`) lists currently paired phones, identified by key fingerprint, with rename and revoke actions - pairing grants all ten capability verbs uniformly, so there is no per-device capability control. Both live under the Mobile heading, which carries all three ids as its `searchIds`; `Paired Devices` renders as a sub-label rather than a third peer heading. The third entry (registry id `mobileBridge.getApp`) is the Mobile section's documentation tail: a one-line blurb plus a **How to install and pair** button linking to the Kangentic Mobile docs (`https://www.kangentic.com/mobile/`), where the install instructions live so they can change without a desktop release. It is deliberately NOT conditioned on the paired-device list being empty - the target is a docs landing page, so a paired user is most of its audience. The first two are backed by the `mobile:*` IPC channels and the signed device roster (`src/main/mobile-bridge/roster-store.ts`), not persisted in `AppConfig`; the docs tail is purely informational.

### Privacy

The Privacy tab is informational only. It displays what anonymous analytics Kangentic collects (app launches, platform, crash reports, task/session counts) and what it does not collect (task content, file paths, usernames, code). Analytics are powered by Aptabase (no cookies, no persistent identifiers, GDPR-compliant). Set `KANGENTIC_TELEMETRY=0` as an environment variable to opt out. It points to the Memory tab for the (fully local) conversation-search controls. Global-only (per-machine).

### Developer

Power-user settings for diagnosing the activity engine and other internal subsystems. Global-only (no per-project override). Also toggleable from anywhere via Ctrl+Shift+D.

| Key | Type | Default | Description |
|-----|------|---------|-------------|
| `developer.activityDebugOverlay` | boolean | `false` | Show the floating activity-engine debug overlay. Renders live counters (pendingToolCount, subagentDepth, bg shells), the current `ActivityReason`, and a ring buffer of recent transitions for every running session in the current project. Polls `getActivityStats` every 2 seconds while open; lazy-disables the IPC when closed. With this on, the engine also writes a per-session JSON snapshot to `<projectRoot>/.kangentic/debug/<sessionId>.json` on every state change for post-mortem reads. |
| `developer.persistConsoleLogs` | boolean | `false` | Persist `info`, `debug`, and `log`-level console output to `<projectRoot>/.kangentic/logs/<YYYY-MM-DD>.log`. Errors and warnings are always persisted regardless of this toggle. NDJSON one file per day. Read via the `kangentic_tail_logs` MCP tool. |
| `developer.recordIpcTraffic` | boolean | `false` | Record IPC traffic to `<projectRoot>/.kangentic/logs/ipc-<YYYY-MM-DD>.jsonl`: inbound handler invocations (channel, args, result, durationMs, errors) plus outbound main-to-renderer pushes (the agent-driven board-invalidation events) tagged `direction: "out"`. Mutating channels (settings writes, MCP config, attachments) appear as `{ redacted: true, channel }` to keep secrets out of disk logs. Off by default - non-trivial disk impact when enabled. Read via `kangentic_get_ipc_log`. |
| `developer.previewInspectionServer` | boolean | dev: `true`, prod: `false` (UI absent in prod) | Bind a localhost-only HTTP inspection bridge that powers the dev-only `kangentic_devtools_*` MCP tools (screenshot, click, type, drag, query DOM, React fiber walker, console, engine + renderer state). Writes a per-worktree lockfile to `<projectRoot>/.kangentic/preview.lock` for cross-instance discovery. Bound to 127.0.0.1 on a random port; no auth (localhost is the boundary). UI affordance excluded from production builds entirely; the key persists in `AppConfig` for type compatibility but has no effect in shipped binaries. |
| `developer.previewEvalEnabled` | boolean | dev: `true`, prod: `false` (UI absent in prod) | Stricter gate on top of `previewInspectionServer`. Enables three high-risk inspection-bridge endpoints: `eval` (run any JavaScript in the renderer), `inject_session_event` (synthesize fake activity-engine events without spawning a real CLI), and `raw PTY input` (write any byte sequence directly to a session terminal, including control codes). Defaults ON in dev builds (mirrors `previewInspectionServer`) so the agent-driven workflow has these available on every `/preview` without a manual toggle; an explicit stored value still wins. Localhost-only and excluded from production builds entirely. |

## Swimlane-Level Configuration

Each swimlane has its own overrides (stored in the per-project DB):

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|-------|------|---------|-------------|
| `description` | string \| null | null | Free-form description of the column's purpose. Shown as a header tooltip and round-trips through `kangentic.json`. |
| `permission_mode` | PermissionMode \| null | null | Permission mode override for this column |
| `auto_spawn` | boolean | true | Whether moving a task here spawns an agent |
| `auto_command` | string \| null | null | Command injected into running session on task arrival |
| `auto_command_mode` | `'immediate'` \| `'deferred'` | `'immediate'` | Whether the auto-command interrupts the agent's current turn or waits for it to finish |
| `plan_exit_target_id` | string \| null | null | Target column when plan-mode agent exits |
| `agent_override` | string \| null | null | Agent CLI override for sessions spawned in this column |
| `model_override` | string \| null | null | Adapter-specific model identifier passed at spawn time (e.g. Claude `--model opus`). Live-applied via `/model` slash on column transition when supported. |
| `effort_override` | string \| null | null | Adapter-specific effort/reasoning level passed at spawn time (e.g. Claude `--effort xhigh`). Live-applied via `/effort` slash on column transition when supported. |
| `handoff_context` | boolean | false | When enabled, cross-agent transitions package prior session context for the target agent |
| `session_target` | `'main'` \| `'isolated'` | `'main'` | Which session track a task runs on in this column. `main` = the task's shared main conversation; `isolated` = this column's own context-isolated session (keyed by the swimlane id). See `SessionTarget` in `src/shared/types.ts`. |
| `session_spawn_strategy` | `'create_or_resume'` \| `'always_spawn_new'` | `'create_or_resume'` | What to do with that session track on column entry. `create_or_resume` resumes the track's session if one exists, else spawns; `always_spawn_new` always spawns fresh, retiring the prior session. Default resolves context-aware (`resolveForceFresh`): isolated columns default to always-fresh. See `SessionSpawnStrategy`. |

## Board Configuration

Kangentic supports shareable board configuration via JSON files in the project root. This lets teams commit their column layout, colors, icons, actions, and transitions to version control so everyone works with the same board structure.

### Two-File System

- **`kangentic.json`** -- the team file. Committed to git and shared with all collaborators. Contains the canonical board layout.
- **`kangentic.local.json`** -- the personal overrides file. Auto-added to `.gitignore`. Contains per-user customizations (colors, icons, extra columns) that merge on top of the team file.

When both files exist, `kangentic.local.json` is merged over `kangentic.json` by matching columns, actions, and transitions by ID. Unmatched local entries are appended.

### Board Config Sync (kangentic.json)

**The sync is bidirectional, and the two directions do not fire on the same events.** Getting
this backwards is the single easiest mistake to make here, so it is spelled out before the
mechanics: editing `kangentic.json` by hand IS a real way to change the board, and it is a
*different* removal path from the UI or MCP with *different* rules.

**Database -> file (export).** Unconditional and automatic. Every swimlane, action, and
transition mutation triggers a debounced write-back, and opening a project writes one too, so the
team always has a current file to commit. If the file already matches the DB state, no write
occurs.

**File -> database (apply).** Gated, but it happens more often than the banner suggests:

1. **On project open**, if `kangentic.json` exists, Kangentic applies it to the database
   **before** the export above. On a conflict the file wins. There is no banner and no prompt on
   this path.
2. **On an external edit while the project is open**, the file watcher raises a reconciliation
   banner (or applies silently when `skipBoardConfigConfirm` is set).

The open-time apply is why a hand-edited `kangentic.json` sticks: the app is not merely writing
to the file, it reads it back as the source of truth for column identity every time the project
loads. It is also why a column deleted through the UI or `kangentic_delete_column` must update
the file in the same operation. If it did not, the next open would re-create the column from the
stale file entry, reusing its original UUID, with nothing logged.

**Removing a column by editing the file is softer than deleting it.** The DB, MCP, and UI paths
all *refuse* to delete a column that still holds tasks. The file path does not: it **ghosts** a
non-empty column instead (see Reconciliation below) and hard-deletes an empty one. Pick the file
path when you want a column retired without first emptying it.

**But the file path does not clean up Board Profiles.** Deleting a column through the UI or
`kangentic_delete_column` also prunes that column out of every profile: the uuid-keyed entry in
`profiles[].columns`, and any `planExitTarget` naming it. Removing the column by hand-editing the
file (or letting an emptied ghost be reaped) does not - those entries are left pointing at a
column that no longer exists. They are inert rather than harmful - strategy resolution looks an
entry up by the *live* column's uuid, so a key no column has is simply never read - but they
accumulate, and a hand-editor reading the file will wonder. The asymmetry is
deliberate: the serializer cannot tell a *deleted* column apart from one a teammate has and you
do not, and it preserves the latter on purpose. If you retire a column by editing the file, drop
its `profiles[].columns` entries in the same edit.

**Two gotchas worth knowing:**

- A hand-written config whose columns carry **no `id` fields is additive only** - it can add and
  update columns but never removes one. Removal requires at least one config column with an `id`.
  Write-back then serializes the real UUIDs for future reconciliation.
- If `kangentic.json` is **unparseable or invalid**, the apply is skipped entirely - but the export
  still runs and **overwrites the file from the database**. How much you lose depends on which
  kind of broken it is:
  - **Unparseable** (bad JSON) loses the keys the database has no column for: `shortcuts`,
    `profiles`, and `defaultBaseBranch`. The export carries those across from the previous file
    contents, so a file it cannot read is a file it cannot carry anything across from.
  - **Parseable but invalid** (missing `version`, zero columns, two columns sharing a name) keeps
    all three. The board still loads from the database and the columns in the file are ignored,
    but the export re-reads the file to preserve those keys, and reading them succeeded.

  Either way the column layout in the file is discarded, so validate a hand edit before opening the
  project.

### File Watching and Reconciliation

Kangentic watches both `kangentic.json` and `kangentic.local.json` for changes. When a change is detected (e.g., a teammate pulls a new version), a reconciliation banner appears in the UI. The user can apply the changes or dismiss the banner. If `skipBoardConfigConfirm` is enabled, changes are applied automatically without the banner.

The same matching rules below also run unprompted on project open, per the sync section above.

Reconciliation matches columns by `id`:
- **Matched columns** are updated with the new properties (name, color, icon, etc.)
- **New columns** (present in file but not in DB) are created
- **Removed columns** (present in DB but absent from the config file and the file has at least one column with an `id`) are handled as follows:
  - If the column has tasks, it becomes a **ghost column** (marked `is_ghost: true`, hidden from the board but preserved so tasks are not lost)
  - If the column is empty, it is deleted

Ghost columns are invisible on the board but still exist in the database. Once all tasks are moved out of a ghost column, it is automatically deleted. This prevents data loss when a teammate removes a column that still holds your in-progress work.

### File Structure

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "columns": [
    {
      "id": "uuid",
      "name": "To Do",
      "role": "todo",
      "icon": "inbox",
      "color": "#6b7280",
      "autoSpawn": false
    },
    {
      "id": "uuid",
      "name": "Executing",
      "description": "Agents actively work tasks here.",
      "icon": "square-terminal",
      "color": "#10b981",
      "autoSpawn": true,
      "permissionMode": "default",
      "autoCommand": null,
      "autoCommandMode": "immediate",
      "planExitTarget": null,
      "agentOverride": null,
      "modelOverride": null,
      "effortOverride": null,
      "handoffContext": false,
      "sessionTarget": "main",
      "sessionSpawnStrategy": "create_or_resume",
      "archived": false
    }
  ],
  "defaultBaseBranch": "main",
  "shortcuts": [],
  "profiles": [
    {
      "id": "uuid",
      "name": "Heavy",
      "columns": {
        "<swimlane-uuid>": { "modelOverride": "opus", "effortOverride": "xhigh" }
      }
    }
  ],
  "actions": [
    {
      "id": "uuid",
      "name": "Start Agent",
      "type": "spawn_agent",
      "config": { "promptTemplate": "{{task_xml}}{{attachments}}" }
    }
  ],
  "transitions": [
    {
      "from": "*",
      "to": "uuid",
      "actions": ["uuid"]
    }
  ],
  "_modifiedBy": "device-id"
}
```

The `defaultBaseBranch` field sets the team-shared default base branch for worktree creation. When present, it takes precedence over the per-user `git.defaultBaseBranch` in `AppConfig`. Individual users can override it via `kangentic.local.json`.

The `_modifiedBy` field is auto-set by Kangentic to record which device last wrote the file (last-writer provenance) and should not be edited manually.

### Hand-Written Configs

Config files written by hand (without `id` fields on columns) are treated as additive only. Kangentic will create the specified columns but will not delete or ghost any existing columns. This allows safe experimentation without risking data loss.

## Permission Mode Resolution (Priority Order)

1. Task's `permission_mode` (if set) - set via the New Task dialog's Advanced section or the task-detail edit form; wins for the task's entire lifetime, column moves cannot change it
2. Swimlane's `permission_mode` (if set)
3. Global `config.agent.permissionMode`

## In-App Announcements

The desktop app periodically fetches a static JSON feed, `announcements.json` on this repo's
`main` branch (served via `raw.githubusercontent.com`), and shows the highest-priority active
announcement as a dismissible banner above the board content; "Learn more" opens a dialog with
the markdown body, external links, and a QR code. There is no backend and no account: an
unreachable, malformed, or empty feed simply means no banner (offline and self-hosted setups
lose nothing). The poll runs 10 seconds after launch and every 4 hours (`src/main/announcements.ts`),
is skipped entirely under `NODE_ENV=test`, and never emits error telemetry.

The banner is not the only way in. A **megaphone button in the title bar** (always present, at the
right end of the icon row just before Settings, beside the update-available indicator) opens the
announcement history and carries a badge counting unread announcements. Rows open the same
"Learn more" dialog, so a dismissed or expired announcement stays re-readable.

Feed schema (`src/shared/announcements.ts`): each entry carries `id`, `title` (banner line),
`body` (markdown intro), `links` (label + https URL; a link flagged `qr: true` renders a large
scannable QR code above its button, for phone-destined links like store opt-in pages), optional
`sections` (titled sub-messages, each `{ heading?, body?, links? }`, for one announcement that
carries several messages such as per-platform statuses), `minVersion` / `maxVersion` (inclusive
version window), `platforms` (`win32` / `darwin` / `linux`; omitted = all - note this targets
the DESKTOP OS, not the user's phone), `publishedAt` / `expiresAt` (ISO 8601), and `priority`.
Unknown fields and malformed entries are ignored, so the feed can grow without breaking released
clients; an entry needing new client behavior sets `minVersion` instead.

**Publishing warning:** an edit to `announcements.json` on `main` is a production push - it
reaches every released client within one poll cycle (about 4 hours, plus ~5 minutes of CDN
cache). Set targeting fields conservatively and put an `expiresAt` on every entry.
`tests/unit/announcements-json-valid.test.ts` validates the committed file through the real
parser on every push, so a typo'd entry (which production would silently drop) fails CI on the
content PR instead of shipping invisible.

**Deleting an expired entry is allowed.** Clients keep their own archive (below), so removing a
long-expired entry from the feed no longer takes it away from anyone who already saw it. Deleting
an entry that has NOT expired still retracts it: it leaves the active list, the banner clears, and
an open banner dialog closes. It stays in the archive of every client that already saw it, and
never enters the archive of one that did not.

### The local archive

Each client keeps `<configDir>/announcements-archive.json`: every announcement that was ever
active **for that client**, most recently seen first, capped at 50 entries with the oldest pruned
on write. Ordering is by when this client first saw an entry, not by the announcement's own
`publishedAt`, so a high-priority older announcement that arrives on a later poll sorts above
entries published after it.
The poll writes it from the same filtered list the banner uses, so targeting is inherited for free
(an announcement that never matched this client never enters its history), and it is what makes the
megaphone useful in the three cases the live feed cannot cover: the ~10 seconds before the first
poll, an offline launch, and an entry deleted upstream. An entry's stored copy is refreshed when
the feed edits it in place, but its `firstSeenAt` and read-state are not. The poll is the only
writer that filters; the ephemeral preview seeds this file directly and does not, so that targeting
guarantee holds everywhere except a preview (see the end of this section).

**Dismissed and read are different states, stored apart:**

| Concept | Stored where | Effect |
|---------|--------------|--------|
| Dismissed | `dismissedAnnouncementIds` in config | hides that announcement's banner strip |
| Read | `readAt` on its archive entry | stops the megaphone badge counting it |

Opening the dialog from either entry point (the banner's "Learn more" or a history row) marks it
read. Dismissing the banner does not: a dismissed-but-unread announcement still lights the badge,
because the megaphone means "there is something you have not read", not "there is a banner". The
badge counts every unread entry, expired ones included.

Read-state cannot live in `dismissedAnnouncementIds` because that list prunes itself to ids still
in the active feed on every write, so it would forget an announcement the moment it expired.

**Authoring contract - no scrolling:** an announcement must fit its dialog without a scrollbar
on a typical desktop window (QR links lay out side by side to help; the dialog's scroll is a
safety valve for very small windows only, and a UI test pins the contract for a realistic
two-QR announcement). Keep bodies to a few short paragraphs and QR links to two or three; if a
message wants more, it should be a link to a page, not a longer announcement.

Dismissals persist per-announcement-id in `dismissedAnnouncementIds` (see the
[Top-Level reference](#top-level)). Read-state does not: it lives on the archive entry.

**The ephemeral preview seeds both states.** A `/preview` boot wipes its data directory, which
takes the archive with it, so the first poll used to re-append every announcement as unread and
relight the badge on every launch. Before Electron starts, `scripts/dev.js` now writes the archive
with every entry's `readAt` stamped AND lists those same ids in `dismissedAnnouncementIds`. Both,
because they are the separate states above: the first darkens the badge, the second keeps the
banner down. `--fresh` skips the seed, so the first-launch experience still shows announcements
unread. A regular `npm start` is unaffected: it uses the real data directory and its real
read-state.

Two limits are deliberate. The seed reads the repo's committed `announcements.json`, so an
announcement published to `main` after this worktree branched is absent from it and still arrives
unread on the next poll; that self-corrects on a rebase. And the seed applies no targeting, so a
preview's history can list an entry that `minVersion` or `platforms` would have filtered for this
client.

## Environment Variables

| Variable | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `KANGENTIC_DATA_DIR` | Override the config/data directory path |
| `KANGENTIC_ANNOUNCEMENTS_URL` | Override the announcements feed URL (for testing against a local fixture) |

## Legacy Migration

On load, the ConfigManager auto-migrates legacy permission mode values:

- `dangerously-skip` → `bypassPermissions`
- `bypass-permissions` → `bypassPermissions`
- `manual` → `acceptEdits` (removed as a separate mode)
- `project-settings` → `acceptEdits`

A parallel normalization runs on swimlane and session records in the DB. Note the swimlane normalization maps the removed `manual` and `project-settings` values to `default` rather than `acceptEdits` (see [Database - Migration Strategy](database.md#migration-strategy)).
